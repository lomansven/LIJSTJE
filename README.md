# Lijstje

'Lijstje' is the most dynamic shopping list you can imagine. It gives users the ability to easily create and share shopping lists, for example for the weekly groceries. Need something from the store? Add it to your shared list and the person running the errands will be notified!

# Why?

This application has been built for fun. To try out technologies I am familiar and unfamiliar with. To see what I am capable of building. This application is also a request from my family to better manage the grocery requests from everyone.

I know little about backend development. I am fimiliar with expressjs technologies I use for this project, but other backend concepts are not of my expertise (yet). This means there might be some fundamental flaws regarding the backend, but I will try my best.

Good chance though that I get an idea for another app and work on that rather than this, we shall see ;)

# Quickstart

In order to check out the application yourself, follow the steps below:

- Install dependencies: 

- Run the frontend application
    - ``cd app``
    - ``npm install``
    - Install all (dev-)dependencies needed to build and start the application
    - ``npm start``
    - This will start the application locally in your browser
- Build and deploy the backend application to the development environment
    - ``cd server`` / ``cd ../server``
    - ``npm install``
    - Install all (dev-)dependencies needed to build and start the application
    - ``npm run deploy:dev``
    - This will deploy the dev Lambda. To deploy the prod Lambda:
    - ``npm run deploy:prod``
